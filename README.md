# earth-imagery-application
A GUI application to provide the user with satellite imagery using APIs. 

This is a work in progress. 

This application uses APIs to access satellite imagery of the earth. 
This was created to increase public visibility of the effects of the climate crisis on regions that are: 

  1. Under an increased risk of destruction due to the consequences of the crisis.
  2. Not usually seen by Western societies. 
At some point the application will support more things, but school is taking up a majority of my time right now.
